choose to do the thing what makes you happy, instead of tired and painful.
your life will become terrible when your action conflicts to the natural law. 

don't be too obsessed on things you can't get right now. try to get what you can, and catch these moments.

enjoy the climbing itself, rush as you can, or just take a nap when you want.  

wish some day i can publish this post.
